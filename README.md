To build the model used clinical dataset of patients having heart attack or not.There are 14 features in the data set.There is no any null values in features.Data distribution of each feature is Standard Normal Distribution.There is no any need of the data transformation.Performed EDA to get the insights from the datset.Also drawn the curve between error rate and K-Value to know the best value of K.Used Hyperparameter Tuning to avoid the model from the overfiting.also did performance evaluation of each algorithms.Logistic regression,KNN and Random forestalgorithm used.`
